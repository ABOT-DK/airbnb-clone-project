# FRONTEND
<br/>

## UI/UX Design Planning
 ### DESIGN GOAL
A good booking system should have a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.
<br/>
<br/>

## Pages	Description	UI
**Page-1** This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal.

**Page-2**	This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the AirBnB clone. It highlights key features such as the property’s name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasizes clarity and ease of use for potential renters.

**Page-3**	This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the AirBnB clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalizing the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience.
<br/>
<br/>

### Key features to be implemented:
**Property Listings:** Display properties with relevant details and images.<br/>
**Booking System:** Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.<br/>
**Search Functionality:** Enable users to search for properties based on various criteria (location, price, availability).<br/>
**User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for users.
<br/>
<br/>

### User-Friendly Design: Why It Matters  
#### **Purpose**  
Make software **intuitive, efficient, and accessible** for all users.  

#### **Benefits**  
- **Faster adoption** – Users learn quickly.  
- **Fewer errors** – Clear guidance = fewer mistakes.  
- **Higher retention** – Happy users stay.  
- **Lower support costs** – Less confusion = fewer tickets.  

#### **Key Principles**  
1. **Simplicity** – Avoid clutter.  
2. **Consistency** – Predictable patterns.  
3. **Feedback** – Confirm actions (e.g., success messages).  
4. **Accessibility** – Works for all abilities (WCAG compliance).  

#### **Example**  
- ❌ Bad: Hidden save button, no error hints.  
- ✅ Good: One-click save, real-time validation.

### Why Security Matters

| Area               | Risks Mitigated                          | Security Importance                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Data**      | Identity theft, spam                     | Protects personal info (emails, passwords) and prevents account takeovers.         |
| **Payments**       | Fraud, chargebacks                       | Ensures financial transactions are irreversible and tamper-proof.                   |
| **Properties**     | Unauthorized edits, fake listings        | Maintains platform integrity and host trust.                                        |
| **Reviews**        | Fake reviews, spam                       | Preserves review authenticity and user confidence.                                  |
| **API Infrastructure** | DDoS, resource exhaustion           | Guarantees service availability and performance under load.                         |

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**CI/CD** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deploying applications.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically builds and tests every code change pushed to the repository.  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploys validated changes to production/staging environments.  

### Why It Matters for This Project
1. **Faster Releases**: Automates repetitive tasks, reducing manual errors and speeding up delivery.  
2. **Early Bug Detection**: Catches issues in development/testing stages before they reach production.  
3. **Consistency**: Ensures every change is tested and deployed in a standardized way.  
4. **Scalability**: Simplifies managing deployments as the project grows.  

### Tools & Workflow
#### Core Tools:
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD automation)  
- **Docker** (Containerization for consistent environments)  
- **PostgreSQL** (Database testing)  
- **Pytest** (Python test automation)  

#### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Code Push**: Triggers the pipeline on `git push` to `main` or feature branches.  
2. **Build**: Creates Docker images for the application.  
3. **Test**: Runs unit/integration tests with Pytest.  
4. **Deploy**:  
   - **Staging**: Auto-deploys to a test environment on successful builds.  
   - **Production**: Manual approval for production deployments.
